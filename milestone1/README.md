## building
Milestone 1 consists of multiple programs, each representing an example for inter-process communication. To build all programs, simply run `make all`. The makefile looks for all files ending with .c and compiles them into an executable with the same name and no extension. The output will be in the `build` folder. To remove the build artifacts, simply run `make clean`.

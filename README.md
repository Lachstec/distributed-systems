# Distributed Systems
This repo contains excercises from my university lecture about distributed systems. You will find various C programs realizing things like inter-process communication, multi-threading, etc.

## Repository Structure
Each directory represents a stand-alone program. You can build it by using the `make` command. Programs are tested under MacOSSonoma and Linux. A readme containing further information about each program can be found in the corresponding directory.
